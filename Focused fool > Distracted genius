1. Genius has 50 tabs open: StackOverflow, Reddit, Medium, 7 YouTube videos. Fool reads ONE page from AWS docs and deploys an S3 bucket tonight. Genius still “researching best practices.”
2. Genius thinks a problem is “too small for my skill level.” Fool writes a stupid Python script that renames 700 files in 3 minutes. Team calls him a lifesaver. Genius stays invisible.
3. Genius dreams of building an “AI-powered automation platform.” Fool just builds a tiny cron job that sends him daily reminders to fix logs. Result: Fool works stress-free. Genius keeps firefighting.
4. Genius keeps everything in his head — messy, chaotic, unusable. Fool writes ugly but clear documentation. Everyone relies on him. Genius is “brilliant but unreliable.”
5. Genius hunts for “big challenging problems.” Fool picks small bugs and crushes them daily. After 3 months: Fool = improved 90 bugs. Genius = still “planning a refactor.”
6. Genius wants to learn Python + Rust + DevOps + Blockchain + AI + Web3 + Cloud + ML. Fool masters just Python and becomes employable.
7. Genius watches 50 tutorials once and remembers nothing. Fool watches ONE Django tutorial 10 times and becomes dangerous. Repetition beats scattered learning.
8. Fool makes a shitty to-do app. Three months later, it's a polished productivity tool. Genius still stuck at “idea validation.”
9. Genius says “I'm not in the flow today.” Fool says “Shut up and commit the damn code.”
10. Fool learns Git, debugging, testing, deployment — the unsexy shit. Genius skips it. Guess who becomes a real engineer? Not the genius.
