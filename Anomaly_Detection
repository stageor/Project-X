Problem Statement
In this exercise, we will implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.

The dataset contains two features -
- throughput (mb/s) and
- latency (ms) of response of each server.
While your servers were operating, you collected $m=307$ examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset $\{x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(m)}\}$.
- We suspect that the vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset. 
We will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in your dataset.
- We will first start on a 2D dataset that will allow you to visualize what the algorithm is doing.
- On that dataset you will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies.
- After that, you will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions.

# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to blue "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
plt.scatter(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], marker='x', c='b') 

# Set the title
plt.title("The first dataset")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Throughput (mb/s)')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Latency (ms)')
# Set axis range
plt.axis([0, 30, 0, 30])
plt.show()
